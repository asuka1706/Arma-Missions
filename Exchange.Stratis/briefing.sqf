Our contact in RAFA leaked details on an arms deal that will take place on Stratis.<br /><br />The location where the deal is going to take place <marker name='marker_exchange'>is marked on the map</marker>.<br /><br />There is a moderate presence of NATO troops on Stratis. Checkpoints are set up on the road entrances to Agia Marina. They rarely inspect vehicles but they will shoot you on sight if they see you openly carrying weapons. Either avoid checkpoints entirely or hide weapons in the trunk."]];
