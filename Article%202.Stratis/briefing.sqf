It's highly likely they will engage you on sight.<br /><br />We are ready to move to Altis. However, it is a good idea to first make a mess on Stratis, which will force COMMARFORCOM to divert some of the forces from Altis.<br /><br />There are two possible ways to do it. The first one is to carry an attack on either Agia Marina or the village of Girna. Make it worthy a local front page, kill at least 5 civilians.<br /><br />If you lack the guts to harm innocents, consider other career options. Anyway, there is yet another target. Air Station Mike-26 hosts vital communication and surveillance facilities. But it is guarded well enough to think of it as a suicide mission. The call is yours.<br /><br />Whichever target you choose, an attack will prompt the closure of the airfield and a call for reinforcement. The Air Station garrison is responsible for security on Stratis and will dispatch for an emergency call from either of the two settlements. Girna is completely unguarded but it's a long way to the airfield by road. Agia Marina is guarded by a small number of US troops but it's next to the airport if you decide to escape Stratis by air. If you decide to escape by water, stay clear of patrol boats."]];
